The provided code is a simple Python script that uses the OpenWeatherMap API to retrieve and display weather information for a city. It accomplishes the following:

  Imports the requests library in order to perform HTTP requests.

Specifies an API key for use with the OpenWeatherMap API.

Two functions are defined:

fetch_weather(api_key, city): This function creates an API request URL with the provided API key and the specified city, sends an HTTP GET request to OpenWeatherMap, and returns weather data in JSON format.
convert_kelvin_to_celsius(temp): By subtracting 273.15, this function converts a temperature in Kelvin to a temperature in Celsius.
Enters a while loop, which gives the user two options:

Option 1: Enter the name of a city.
Option 2: Close the weather app.
User input is used to determine the user's preference.

If the user selects option 1, they are prompted to enter the name of their city.

If the user selects option 2, the application closes.

If the user makes an incorrect selection, an error message is displayed and the loop continues.

When a valid city name is entered, the script invokes the fetch_weather function to retrieve weather information for the specified city.

If weather data is available, it extracts and displays the weather condition and temperature (in Celsius).

If the weather data for the specified city is not found, it displays a message indicating that it was not found.

The script functions primarily as a basic weather application, allowing the user to look up weather information for a city by entering its name and displaying the current weather condition and temperature in Celsius.
